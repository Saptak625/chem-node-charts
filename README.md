# chem-node-charts
This project creates a png file picture of the graph of the different ways that a chemical equation can be solved. 
Main method in ChemicalEquationNodeChart.java. 
You will also have to replace the file name in the NodeGraph.java where you will save the graph.png.

## Graph Screenshot
Graph of K4Fe(CN)6 + KMnO4 + H2SO4 = KHSO4 + Fe2(SO4)3 + MnSO4 + HNO3 + CO2 + H2O:

## Conclusion
This program can be used find many details about the process to solve a given equation such as how many variables will be needed given the Simplified Algebraic Method or if naive Geuss and Check method, that most people use, can solve the given equation. For an implementation of the Simplified Algebraic Method, visit [here](https://github.com/Saptak625/chem-equation-balancers-java). This balancer has also been written in Python recently. That link will be posted here soon. 

Credit to Jamin Santiago for the Simplified Algebraic Method. A link for his work on the method is below.
